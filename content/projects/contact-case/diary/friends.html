When you have any kind of personal project that requires extra energy that you really don't have after your 9-5 job, it's a blessing to have great friends that support you and encourage your work.  Thanks to the Munsons who have been such a support from the very beginning.  Ben even pulled out his dremel to help refine the design. Also, Edward for your engineering mind and tips, the Cinco product team who shared my enthusiasm and those who gave me that extra pat on the back to keep this going. You know who you are.
