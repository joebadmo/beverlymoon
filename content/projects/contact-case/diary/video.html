We worked all weekend to shoot the Kickstarter video. I'm very camera shy, so it wasn't easy. I think we got some good product shots and it's going to be a simple and direct video. Thank you Ben for the peanut M&Ms, Cineskates, and all those funny conversations caught on video. I also could not have done this without my husband who was the camera man and sound engineer behind all this. Love you guys!
