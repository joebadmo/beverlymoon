These were the two final concepts that I ended up with back in March. I looked at a 'pill'-shaped design that was similar to other plastic designs in the market and a rounded square design that was more distinct and sculptural. After much discussion and thought, I decided to go with with the rounded rectangle one because it was more disruptive and different than the other designs out there.
