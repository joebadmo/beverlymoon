Exploring packaging for the product. I'm not a graphic designer by any means so I'm not going to attempt to do any fancy illustrations. Just a simple and straightforward design that allows the product to be the hero. I will be sourcing local packaging and choosing materials that are eco-friendly. I didn't do my research very well for my samples so the first boxes were not made in the USA. Future products will ship only in made in USA packaging.
