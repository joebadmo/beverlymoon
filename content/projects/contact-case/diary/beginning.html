It's been almost a year since the idea first popped into my head and more than a month since I actually took the initiative to get started on this project. Today, I brought Joe along to the place where the cases will be manufactured. 

There were some numbers and a few technical details we needed to hash out before we could get this rolling. I was excited when Stuart, my point of contact at Small Parts, took me on the tour the last time I visited, so I was glad when he offered to show Joe around. It's nice to see the machines, the workers, and the space behind everything and I wanted to share that experience with him. The sound of drilling mixed with the smell of oil and the mass of the machines... all of it is just so raw and physical. And it's surprisingly calm in there. 

I ordered the materials to make 50 sets tonight and they should arrive next week. So if all goes well... we might start the first production by the end of next week. Wow.
