We were in San Francisco this weekend, visiting friends and celebrating November birthdays. Thought it would be a good time to push that big green "launch" button amongst close friends. 

It's [officially up](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mooncases/moon-contact-lens-case)! Thank you Teo Dabov for being my first backer.
