Picking out colors for the first sample production was not that easy since there were so many choices and I was limited to only 2 or 3 colors. Joe and I took some samples to our bathroom and looked at neutral colors that might work well in most homes. 

I decided that "Natural Grey" and "Glacier Ice" were the two colors that could really look beautiful on a bathroom sink. Super excited and nervous about the color choices!
