I wanted to take nicer shots of the products for the website, so today Joe and I went to my office to set up a more "professional" photo shoot. It was great to experiment with lighting and a fancy camera. It's pretty amazing to really enjoy learning something and work toward a goal with my husband. It's not like work at all. We were pretty happy with the results. Thank you Schaar for helping us set up!
