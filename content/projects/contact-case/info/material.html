I chose Corian&reg; for very specific reasons. First, it's a hypoallergenic, non-toxic material, and non-porous so it doesn't harbor the growth of bacteria and minimizes the risk of infections. Second, it's a beautiful material. It has a pleasant weight and smooth texture that gives it a premium feel. Third, it's a great material because it's hard, but not brittle, making it easier to find local CNC manufacturing to work with. Lastly, the variety of colors allowed me a lot of freedom as a designer.
