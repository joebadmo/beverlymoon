	<p>It's a routine that many of us go through at least twice a day and it's an object that holds a prominent place on the bathroom sink.</p>

	<p>But it's an experience and product that gets overlooked. Many of the currently available cases are designed with functionality in mind but without much thought put into the user experience. Screw caps are great for travel but not for quick daily interactions. And plastics have many great properties but often feel very cheap. Right and left indicators aren't always necessary.</p>

	<p>I wanted an object that complemented my space and felt good in my hands. So I applied simple, modern design to beautiful materials to make the MOON Case for a more refined everyday experience.</p>
