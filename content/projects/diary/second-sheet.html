I just dropped off another sheet of Corian at SMP to finish up the first sample run. I had a hard time trying to find Corian sheets for the first run of sample production.

Lots of headaches talking to various local shops and big box retailers. I finally got in touch with a rep and he graciously opened his own home to let me rummage through his piles of samples. So excited to see so many colors and options.
