### Pretty Mundane Objects

This project aims to make the everyday beautiful. To take a second look at the mundane objects that we use daily and re-think our interactions with them.

Itâ€™s not about designing new things, but refining the experiences and relationships between us and our objects. It's about looking at products that are essential to our routine, but that most designers haven't bothered to observe. 

The project is to make the mundane pretty.

My objective is to redesign one object per year.
