### Beverly Ng Moon

I'm a senior product experience designer for [Cinco&nbsp;Design](http://cincodesign.com), based in sunny Portland, Oregon. 

My passion is for curating experiences through products and invoking beauty in everyday things.

Always curious, I'm looking for refreshing new projects and like-minded individuals to collaborate with.
