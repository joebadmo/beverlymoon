&lt;p&gt;You guys should check out the other great projects that &lt;a href=&#34;http://kickstarter.com&#34;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; is hosting. It&amp;#8217;s a great site that offers crowd source funding to creative&amp;nbsp;individuals.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;I wanted to take nicer shots of the products for the website, so today Joe and I went to my office to set up a more &amp;#8220;professional&amp;#8221; photo shoot. It was great to experiment with lighting and a fancy camera. It&amp;#8217;s pretty amazing to really enjoy learning something and work toward a goal with my husband. It&amp;#8217;s not like work at all. We were pretty happy with the results. Thank you Schaar for helping us set&amp;nbsp;up!&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

Thanks to the Munsons who have been such a support from the very beginning.  Ben even pulled out his dremel to help refine the design. Also, Edward for your engineering mind and tips, the Cinco product team who shared my enthusiasm and those who gave me that extra pat on the back to keep this going.

Just a simple and straightforward design that allows the product to be the hero. I will be sourcing local packaging and choosing materials that are eco-friendly. I didn&amp;#8217;t do my research very well for my samples so the first boxes were not made in the &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;. Future products will ship only in made in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;packaging. &lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;I thought that this whole process was almost over but it seems like there might be more revisions than I anticipated.  Good thing is that I have a few to give away and feel out how users are liking&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;These were the two final concepts that I ended up with back in March. I looked at a &amp;#8216;pill&amp;#8217;-shaped design that was similar to other plastic designs in the market and a rounded square design that was more distinct and sculptural. After much discussion and thought, I decided to go with with the rounded rectangle one because it was more disruptive and different than the other designs out&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been almost a year since the idea first popped into my head and more than a month since I actually took the initiative to get started on this project. Today, I brought Joe along to the place where the cases will be&amp;nbsp;manufactured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some numbers and a few technical details we needed to hash out before we could get this rolling. I was excited when Stuart, my point of contact at Small Parts, took me on the tour the last time I visited, so I was glad when he offered to show Joe around. It&amp;#8217;s nice to see the machines, the workers, and the space behind everything and I wanted to share that experience with him. The sound of drilling mixed with the smell of oil and the mass of the machines&amp;#8230; all of it is just so raw and physical. And it&amp;#8217;s surprisingly calm in&amp;nbsp;there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered the materials to make 50 sets tonight and they should arrive next week. So if all goes well&amp;#8230; we might start the first production by the end of next week.&amp;nbsp;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
