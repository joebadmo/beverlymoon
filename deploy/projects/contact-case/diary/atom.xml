                                &lt;p&gt;First 45 samples were ready to be picked up. Talked to Stuart, a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SPM&lt;/span&gt; employee who&amp;#8217;s been more than helpful along this process, about the troubles that they&amp;#8217;ve been having with the lid and how the taper is causing the material to kick up and&amp;nbsp;crack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that this whole process was almost over but it seems like there might be more revisions than I anticipated.  Good thing is that I have a few to give away and feel out how users are liking&amp;nbsp;it. &lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;This is our first project collaboration together and it has been pretty gratifying. Joe has been glued in front of the computer for the past few weeks creating a website for the&amp;nbsp;product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is being so open creatively and never says &amp;#8216;no&amp;#8217; to an idea even though it&amp;#8217;s his first website. Full Moon in effect.&amp;nbsp;;p&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;I just dropped off another sheet of Corian at &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SMP&lt;/span&gt; to finish up the first sample run. I had a hard time trying to find Corian sheets for the first run of sample&amp;nbsp;production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of headaches talking to various local shops and big box retailers. I finally got in touch with a rep and he graciously opened his own home to let me rummage through his piles of samples. So excited to see so many colors and&amp;nbsp;options. &lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Just picked the first article to approve today! It was so satisfying to finally see a physical sample after months of designing and researching. 
It was nearly perfect. There are just a few changes that I&amp;#8217;ll have to make but I&amp;#8217;m really happy with the design and result. It&amp;#8217;s been wonderful working with&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SPM&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;Picking out colors for the first sample production was not that easy since there were so many choices and I was limited to only 2 or 3 colors. Joe and I took some samples to our bathroom and looked at neutral colors that might work well in most&amp;nbsp;homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that &amp;#8220;Natural Grey&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Glacier Ice&amp;#8221; were the two colors that could really look beautiful on a bathroom sink. Super excited and nervous about the color&amp;nbsp;choices!&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                                &lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been almost a year since the idea first popped into my head and more than a month since I actually took the initiative to get started on this project. Today, I brought Joe along to the place where the cases will be&amp;nbsp;manufactured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some numbers and a few technical details we needed to hash out before we could get this rolling. I was excited when Stuart, my point of contact at Small Parts, took me on the tour the last time I visited, so I was glad when he offered to show Joe around. It&amp;#8217;s nice to see the machines, the workers, and the space behind everything and I wanted to share that experience with him. The sound of drilling mixed with the smell of oil and the mass of the machines&amp;#8230; all of it is just so raw and physical. And it&amp;#8217;s surprisingly calm in&amp;nbsp;there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ordered the materials to make 50 sets tonight and they should arrive next week. So if all goes well&amp;#8230; we might start the first production by the end of next week.&amp;nbsp;Wow.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
