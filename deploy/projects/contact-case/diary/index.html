            <p>It&#8217;s been almost a year since the idea first popped into my head and more than a month since I actually took the initiative to get started on this project. Today, I brought Joe along to the place where the cases will be&nbsp;manufactured. </p>
<p>There were some numbers and a few technical details we needed to hash out before we could get this rolling. I was excited when Stuart, my point of contact at Small Parts, took me on the tour the last time I visited, so I was glad when he offered to show Joe around. It&#8217;s nice to see the machines, the workers, and the space behind everything and I wanted to share that experience with him. The sound of drilling mixed with the smell of oil and the mass of the machines&#8230; all of it is just so raw and physical. And it&#8217;s surprisingly calm in&nbsp;there. </p>
<p>I ordered the materials to make 50 sets tonight and they should arrive next week. So if all goes well&#8230; we might start the first production by the end of next week.&nbsp;Wow.</p>

            <p>I had a hard time trying to find some Corian sheets for the first run of sample production.  Lots of headaches talking to various local shops and big box&nbsp;retailers. </p>
<p>I finally got in touch with a rep and he graciously opened his own home to let me rummage through his piles of samples. So excited to see so many colors and options. I&#8217;ve been looking at the material online for the past few months and to actually feel the samples and see the colors was really&nbsp;helpful.</p>

            <p>Picking out colors for the first sample production was not that easy since there were so many choices and I was limited to only 2 or 3 colors. Joe and I took some samples to our bathroom and looked at neutral colors that might work well in most&nbsp;homes. </p>
<p>I decided that &#8220;Natural Grey&#8221; and &#8220;Glacier Ice&#8221; were the two colors that could really look beautiful on a bathroom sink. Super excited and nervous about the color&nbsp;choices!</p>

            <p>Just picked the first article to approve today! It was so satisfying to finally see a physical sample after months of designing and researching. 
It was nearly perfect. There are just a few changes that I&#8217;ll have to make but I&#8217;m really happy with the design and result. It&#8217;s been wonderful working with&nbsp;<span class="caps">SPM</span>.</p>

            <p>I just dropped off another sheet of Corian at <span class="caps">SMP</span> to finish up the first sample run. I had a hard time trying to find Corian sheets for the first run of sample&nbsp;production. </p>

            <p>This is our first project collaboration together and it has been pretty gratifying. Joe has been glued in front of the computer for the past few weeks creating a website for the&nbsp;product. </p>
<p>He is being so open creatively and never says &#8216;no&#8217; to an idea even though it&#8217;s his first website. Full Moon in effect.&nbsp;;p</p>

            <p>First 45 samples were ready to be picked up. Talked to Stuart, a <span class="caps">SPM</span> employee who&#8217;s been more than helpful along this process, about the troubles that they&#8217;ve been having with the lid and how the taper is causing the material to kick up and&nbsp;crack. </p>
<p>I thought that this whole process was almost over but it seems like there might be more revisions than I anticipated.  Good thing is that I have a few to give away and feel out how users are liking&nbsp;it. </p>
